**Comparision of result is shown as seperately in comparision.docx in result folder
**
OpenCV library is used to make program runnable in c++, python and matlab.

In matlab: program run by just running gui.m and giving some thershold value it will give result after applying gaussian blur on image and find magnitude of image to give edge of image

In java,pyhton,c++: The same process will be follow but coding will change
